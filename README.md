# SmartPCA-Capstone
This repository contains the version 1 code for my team's Human-Centered Design &amp; Engineering (HCDE) Capstone project @ University of Washington. The code in this repository runs on an Arduino Uno with Adafruit's 3.5" touchscreen TFT.

We researched, designed, prototyped, evaluated, and iterated upon a two-compartment touchscreen smart device for post-operative patients that holds and dispenses prescription opioids in one compartment and Tylenol (or other OTC pain medication) in the other while tracking dose timing and recording dose data.

Some of the code in this repository was written in haste and ignores proper OOP/coding conventions.
